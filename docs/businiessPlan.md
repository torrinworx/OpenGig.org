# Executive Summary

OpenGig is a cooperatve platform located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Our goal is to create a fair labour marketplace platform that equally benifits workers, consumers, and employees so all may thrive. Modern day labour platforms are wastful and predatory; they lead to workers and customers suffering financially in the name of sharholder value. OpenGig wants to change this by running a lean at-cost cooperative venture that cuts down on the reckless spending seen with traditional startups and labour platforms.

A cooperative structure is ideal for the market we are tackling, most marketplace and labour platforms aren't even profitable using their current investor lead business structure. OpenGig aims to solve the modern day investor-startup relationship by letting users, both workers and customers, to be directly invested in the coop, much like how credit unions function.

Instead of charging unknown fees, surge pricing, and various other dark pattern tactics to trick our users into giving us the maximum amount of money, we will charge a fair usage fee per transaction that will be calcualted based on our real expendature, rather than the amount of money our users have in their wallets. An at-cost platform. The true cost to run a modern digital platform is far less then you'd expect if your in the know about how large labour platform valuations are. The actual cost to pay employees fair wages, cost of hardware, marketing, legal, domains, deployments, and maintenence is not the issue; investors, executive sallaries and bonuses, missmanaged ventures, stock buy backs, and other wasteful startup gimics like ping pong table, craft beer on tap, slides, nerf gun battles, and bean bag chairs are the true scurge on users wallets.

Our cooperative structure means that employees are held accountable for their choices and management of the platform by the workers and employees, ensuring a responsible business model that is profitable and fair for all memebers, workers, customers, and employees.

OpenGig will emancipate workers and customers from the unfair and illegal practices that other labor platforms perpetuate, by providing a transparent, equitable, and member-driven alternative that prioritizes their well-being and freedom.


# Business Description
OpenGig is a labour platform that connects customers and workers to conduct both long and short term contractual labour. OpenGig is designed for any form of labor from food delivery, constructing furnature, electrician work, graphic design, production of goods, ride hailing, etc. The goal is to provide a fair and equal platform 

## Cooperative Governance Structure
OpenGig is a multi stakeholder cooperative with three types of memebers: workers, customers, and employees. All memebers have voting rights on cooperative votes for major decisions on running the platform and feature improvements.

### Employees
**Employees** are memebers of the cooperative that design and develop the platform, as well as  manage the **Core Team**. **Employees** are trusted to have the expertise to evaluate the technical and operational needs of the cooperative. This includes managing the development, marketing, legal, managearial, and hiring needs of the cooperative.

The governance system of employees is such that while employees are trusted to run the platform, any of their decisions can be reversed if a vote is called to reverse a decision. These can include anything from payment resturcturings, feature development, employee hirings, or rebranding efforts.

The goal is to allow employees to make quick, informed decisions, while also allowing for accountability if they abuse their power.

### Workers
**Workers** are the memebers of the cooperative that advertise, and execute labour for monetary compensation from **Customers**.

### Customers
**Customers** are the memebers of the cooperative that purchase labour or products from **workers**.

### Vote Proposals

OpenGig has an open submission voting system where all members are able to submit a vote proposal on our dedicated public forum (to be built). Members will be required to submit basic criteria for proposals, such as a clear description of the issue, proposed solutions, and the impact on different stakeholders. Each proposal will have a deadecated public comment section, allowing members of other stakeholder groups to have their voices heard.

### Vote Vetting
Members can express initial interest or disapproval by upvoting or downvoting proposals on the forum. Votes get approved and go forward to be member wide votes if they pass the **active member vote threshold**, a (to be determined) percentage of the active members of OpenGig.
