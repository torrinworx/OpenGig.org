# A simple document to onboard local KW contractors to the idea of OpenGig, how they benefit, and what is expected from them

Generally contractors will partner with OpenGig simply by signing up for accounts, providing experience feedback, hosting a store front with multiple gigs and services they offer, and directing some of their customers onto the platform to use themselves.

This means two things: 1. they will pay a small transaction fee per transaction (when Stripe and the payment sysetm is setup), and 2. they will be partnered with us and encouraged to tell their customers to sign up through the company.

the goal here is to generate ideas on what contractors are expecting and want from a platform like this, maybe they want a ledger system to help with their taxes and bookeeping? Maybe they want to export their transaction history to a csv? etc.

this will help with feature ideas and help build the platform out to best optimize for onboarding of contractors. We need to find if they have nay fears, will they keep their customers? Are they nervous about brining their customers onto a platform they might not trust? How can we mitigate their fears and reassure them? Maybe we could provide a simple export option to allow them to export and notify their users, similar to the old youtube video notifications system. They could export all the contacts for their customers, and notify them of anything about their service.

This document should be an outline that we send to contractors and people we want to onboard onto the platform for beta testing, what our expectations are, and what they should expect from us.

- This is a beta platform, all data uploaded, created, and stored on the platform including the creation of accounts shouldn't be relied uppon initially. Due to the nature of software development we may need to wipe the database of all data during the beta testing period, if this happens all data uploaded to the platform may be deleted.

- You will not pay anything up front, we make our money off of transaction fees. You receive money from your client, you and your client both pay a small fee to cover the cost of running the servers that host the site. The cost is based on the projected cost of hosting the website for a given month, devided up among user transactions. (this sytsem needs to be built out along with stripe, but first we need a database)

- We encourage you to tell your customers about OpenGig and ask them to sign up to the platform to take full advantage of the site. We have a transparent payment system setup that allows you to list your prices, send your customers contracts, and export
