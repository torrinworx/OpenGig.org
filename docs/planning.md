Companies like Uber take obsurd amounts of money from the contractors on their app. They treat their drivers like trash, and overcharge both the drivers and the customers, and utilize dark patterns to do so. They are able to accumulate so much wealth with this aweful greedy system, they started an autonomous driving division, a wasteful failure that ended with them having to sell it off due to financial challenges. Since it's founding in 2009, Uber has never been profitable, they have been coasting off of investor money, and have been sucking the money out of drivers and customer pockets along the way. They reported their first profit in the second quarter of 2023, 14 years after their founding, with a total profit of $1.8 Billion for that year. The company is valued at $152.27 Billion as of writing on September 16th, 2024. This is obsurd, a failure of our governments and social safety nets.

Dark patterns:
- Uber knowingly pays drivers below minimum wage.
- The fluctuate their payouts to drivers to force them to work overtime to make ends meet.

"unicorn" should be taken as an insult; a ficticous company that is a made up fairy tail designed to playcate the imaginations of investors who fund delusional spending pits. unicorn startups have multiple characteristics that differentiate themselves form legitimate businesses and startups:

- unicorn startups often receive large investments, providing them with more money than they need to build an effective service or product. This can lead to spending on non-essential ventures, ego, unnecessary staffing, or over-engineering products. Much of this appears to come from ignorance and a desire to grow for the sake of growth and a perverted self interest. Our goal as humans should be to better the world around us for the sake of self preservation and those around us, your apart of this world.
- Many unicorn startups prioritize rapid growth and user acquisition over sustainability. This can lead to high marketing spending and steep discounts that may not be sustainable. Yes this business model is attractive, capture the market quickly and wastefully without thinking about or developing a business model, absorb or destroy competition, establish a monopoly that preemptively disuades and discourrages competition, then once that's all done, jack up the prices and screw over the users you "captured." Aptly named "blitz scaling", after the most ethical regime in history that did absolutely nothing wrong, yes let's name a business concept after a tactic used to perpetuate genocide.
- The race to capture market share often involves expensive marketing campaigns.Good for growth, costly and unsustainable long term. The bait and switch is not ethical, a switch from reasonably priced, or stupidly priced, deals and savings, to a complete looting of peoples savings and spending power.
- As companies grow, the technical infrastructure becomes cumbersome and expensive, especially if built quickly or without foresight. This will always happen with unicorn startups due to the pressure to scale.
- Ego and Bloat, unicorn startups are rife with this. Uneccisary manageral structures, completely wasteful aws spending, over complication, petty drama, all fueled by ego and pride to showboat, display to the world how valueable they are, that they contribute. It's like green washing, but for contributing to society. A way to fake importence.

Some solutions are ethically incompatible with the structure of a capitalist business and do not benifit from it's interests. And that's ok. There is this obsessive need in both conservative (primarily), libertarian, and liberal circles to privatize and profitize every social service from drivers liscenses, healthcare, insurance, the 407, the LCBO, Air Canada, Canada National Railway, Ontario Hydro, grocery stores, prison services, public education, water, public transportation, postal services, etc. Privatizing these services is a disgusting and unethical act that should be shamed and reverted. Each and every single one leads to higher consumer costs, higher deaths, decreased quality of life, higher burden on tax payers, higher burden on households, and much suffering, all in the name of profit, and shareholder and investor value. It has become an ego driven blind cult of complacency. Our laws and leaders have failed us. Services and core functions of life should not be privatized, they should not be comoditized for the sake of endless growth. We don't need endless growth. In the age of environmentalizm and global climate catastrophe we need sustainable organizations that can offer **social services**, not to be confused with social security, but structures of organized people that serve the public interest in developing products and services, not shareholders, not the stock market, not investors, the public. We need to create structures and models that can allow individauls to inovate, compete, and exist without the narcasistic and greedy urge to grow.

What do we do to change this? 

We need a mechanism that will insentivize **social services** for the public good. The stock market was designed to provide value to companies that compete and do well, while providing returns to those who took the risk to invest savings and money early on in the business. We need a system instead designed for public good, that provides returns on making the world a better place, on providing a higher quality of life to all. Capitalism provided the means to lift an absurd number of people out of poverty, yes, this must be aknowledged. But it doesn't scale. It isn't designed to prevent adversarial forces from taking advantage of it and gaining a dangerous stranglhold.

I argue that the structure of unicorn startups is ineificient, adversarial to human interests, a stronghold for narcassism, and a breeding ground for unimportant dipshits who want the worlds attention to validate their existence rather than finding it in helping others and bettering our world. I argue we can compete, we can do better and overtake these unicorn startups with simple open source platforms that are well designed and follow simplicity, rather then chasing the latest tech trend and bubble.

We need to accept that some achivements, both scientific, technological, phyilisophical, and societal will not happen under capitalism. Much like how the steam engine would have never happend under fuedalism, there weren't enough steel mines, syply chains, metalergists, and systems of insentive to produce that invoation which led to the industrial revolution. Advancements in technology are tied to advancments in society and it's structure. The mode of production, currently capitalism, affects the social and cultural superstructures, influencing and limiting what kinds of achievements are pursued and realized.

The end of growth? When does a service reach it's peak of usefullness? When does it no longer need updates? Can we build something that can last, serving it's designed purpose? Yes. Systems can be built that get replaced by a superset, or abstraction, or a new technoligical advancment, and this is good, we can get ride of the old advancment and stop wasting time and resources on it. But capitalist interestes have this obsessive need to maintain the status quo, even if it's inifficient, even if it's destructive, even if it's deadly. Look to oil, look to the seeping tenticales that control our society, that control our governments decisions to build pipelines over solar plants, that control our national interests, where wars are fought. We have new technology, however the oil industry is intrenched with control in our society that we cannot shake it free even though capitalism itself has created more efficient and overal better alternatives, solar, nuclear, wind. Technologies that are cheaper than they have ever been. Cheaper than gass and oil. Capitalism states these should overthrow the oil industry, become market leaders. The lack of an end state, the lack of a final service that serves it's purpose to the public, the lack of true public control, public say, oversight, let's these structures control our society, dictate wars that are faught, and inflict human missery on billions.

Why focus on gig work? It's simple, this is the worst, most disgusting and egregious cesspool, we should tackle it first.

> What would happen if we just open sourced everything? If we put it all in a public repo with an open license like MIT, our investors would probably have thought that we'd gone crazy. But other than that, what direct impact would that have had on our company?

The value of a project or a company isn't it's source code, its the brains behind it, the people who make it, who can update it, who can improve it. And that isn't something you can hack into and download and easily reproduce.

The gig economy and gig platforms are fundamentally unethical, they derive themselves from a manipulative and subversive tactic to undermine a value of human labour. It is necessary to provide people the means and ability to profit from their labour, which is why these platforms are necessary. However, what is unethical about these platforms is that they are designed for profit rather than public good.

This structure is different from traditional open source projects like Linux or Blender. It's a service, something that has an ongoing real cost associated with it; hosting, internet, power, payment processors, networking, etc. This requires special consideration to maintain the open nature and prevent perverse insentives from taking advantage of it's struggle to servive and prosper.

# TODO:
**Pitch to retail stores**
Similar to how instacart had to work with stores to integrate things like inventory management into their app, we must have a pitch both customers, workers, and retailers for those gigs to work.

We need to understand if/how these platforms are hurting retial stores, and how we can offer them a better deal/pitch this to them.
https://www.mercatus.com/blog/how-instacart-platform-is-doing-grocery-businesses-more-harm-than-good/

Might be a good idea to start with independent grocerors, or small chains/stores first, possibly even partner with farmers or go directly to local food producers.

Things to work on:
- Cite and find sources to back up claims about capitalism. Show examples to better argue for strcutral issues rather than issues with individual companies, show them as symptoms of a larger problem then a direct cause. The gig economy is arguably one of the worst examples of exploitation, however it was still allowed to propser under this system.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Tone and Language:** The use of expletives and charged language can detract from the professionalism and perceived credibility. Terms like unicorn startups” might alienate readers who prefer a more measured discourse.
2. **Lack of Specifics on Implementation:** While the goals of transparency and public good are clear, the text lacks details on how OpenGig.org would implement these principles practically. Specific business models, revenue streams, or case studies of similar projects could strengthen the argument.
3. **Historical and Economic Arguments:** The text makes several sweeping claims about capitalism and historical events without sufficient context or evidence. More nuanced and supported arguments could bolster credibility.
4. **Audience Targeting:** The document appears to target a very specific audience and could benefit from broadening its appeal by presenting its ideas in a manner more palatable to a wider range of stakeholders, including potential partners or users.
5. **Assumptions on Capitalism:** The argument assumes that capitalism cannot accommodate or benefit from open-source principles. While it questions the system effectively, it doesn't explore potential synergies or reforms within a capitalist framework.
6. **Sustainability Concerns:** Addressing sustainability in terms of continuous funding and quality control for an open-source service platform is essential. The document acknowledges the necessity for fair compensation, but it lacks a detailed explanation of how financial stability and service quality will be balanced. Talk about Wikimedia Foundation and how profitable and sustainable they are. The Internet Archive. Mozilla Foundation. OpenStreetMap Foundation. Khan Academy. Let's Encrypt. etc.


**Flaws:**

- The argument often conflates systemic issues with individual company practices, lacking a balanced view that acknowledges the positive aspects of current models alongside criticisms.
- There is an assumption that open-source equates to societal benefit without addressing potential challenges, such as funding and sustaining the platform while maintaining the quality of service.

Dive into the payment and donation model ideas and how we could develop a fair community donation method. Since we would have transactions happening on the platform, we could be transparent during transactions "This is how much the resources you've used cost, please consider donating a portion of your transaction to the community (both to contractos/drivers/gig works and users) because both sides use up resources. It should be raw and bare metal as possible, showing the direct electrical, hosting, salary, and what ever other costs, all automatically calculated to get the most real amount.

# Terminology
It's important that we define the terminology used in our documents and messaging:

- **worker(s).** A person (or persons) who completes a specified gig to earn an income.
- **customer(s).** A person (or persons) who pays for the specified gig to be completed.
- **developer(s).** A person (or persons) responsible for building, deploying, and maintining a digital platform to faciliate the actions of the **workers** and **customers**.
